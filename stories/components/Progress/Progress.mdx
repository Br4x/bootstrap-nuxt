# Progress

> Use our custom progress component for displaying simple or complex progress bars, featuring
> support for horizontally stacked bars, animated backgrounds, and text labels.

<Canvas of={ProgressStory.Progress} />

## Value

Set the maximum value with the `max` prop (default is `100`), and the current value via the `value`
prop (default `0`).

When creating multiple bars in a single process, place the value prop on the individual
`<b-progress-bar>` sub components (see the **Multiple Bars** section below for more details)

## Labels

Add labels to your progress bars by either enabling `show-progress` (percentage of max) or
`show-value`for the current absolute value. You may also set the precision (number of digits after
the decimal) via the `precision` prop (default is `0`digits after the decimal).

<Canvas of={ProgressStory.Labels} />

### Custom progress label

Need more control over the label? Provide your own label by using the default slot within a
`<b-progress-bar>` sub-component, or by using the `label` or `label-html` property on
`<b-progress-bar>`:

<Canvas of={ProgressStory.CustomProgressLabel} />

Precedence order for label methods (top-most has precedence):

- default slot of `<b-progress-bar>`
- `label` prop of `<b-progress-bar>`
- `show-progress` prop of `<b-progress-bar>`
- `show-value` prop of `<b-progress-bar>`
- `show-progress` prop of `<b-progress>`
- `show-value` prop of `<b-progress>`
- no label

## Width and height

`<b-progress>` will always expand to the maximum with of its parent container. To change the width,
place `<b-progress>` in a standard Bootstrap column or apply one of the standard Bootstrap width
classes.

<Canvas of={ProgressStory.WidthAndHeight} />

The height of the progress bar can be controlled with the `height` prop. The height value should be
a standard CSS dimension (`px`, `rem`, `em`, etc.). The default height is `1rem`.

<Canvas of={ProgressStory.WidthAndHeight1} />

## Backgrounds

Use background variants to change the appearance of individual progress bars. The default variant is
`primary`.

### Solid background variants

<Canvas of={ProgressStory.SolidBackgroundVariants} />

### Striped backgrounds

Set `striped` to apply a stripe via CSS gradient over the progress bar's background variant.

<Canvas of={ProgressStory.StripedBackgrounds} />

### Animated backgrounds

The striped gradient can also be animated by setting the `animated`prop.

<Canvas of={ProgressStory.AnimatedBackgrounds} />

Notes:

- if `animated` is true, `striped` will automatically be enabled.
- Animated progress bars don't work in Opera 12 â€” as they don't support CSS3 animations.
- The animation effect of this component is dependent on the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
  See the [reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation](/docs/reference/accessibility)
  for additional details.

## Multiple bars

Include multiple `<b-progress-bar>` sub-components in a `<b-progress>` component to build a
horizontally stacked set of progress bars.

<Canvas of={ProgressStory.MultipleBars} />

`<b-progress-bar>` will inherit most of the props from the `<b-progress>` parent component, but you
can override any of the props by setting them on the `<b-progress-bar>`

Notes:

- `height`, if specified, should always set on the `<b-progress>` component.
- `<b-progress-bar>` will not inherit `value` from `<b-progress>`.
