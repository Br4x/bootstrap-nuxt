# Layout and Grid System

> Use the powerful mobile-first flexbox grid (via the `<b-container>`, `<b-row>`, `<b-form-row>` and
> `<b-col>` components) to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system,
> five default responsive tiers, CSS Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.

BootstrapVue provides several convenient _functional_ components tailored for layout, which can
simplify your complex page markup compared to traditional Bootstrap v4 markup. Feel free to switch
back and forth between traditional Bootstrap v4 markup (i.e. `<div>`s and classes) and
BootstrapVue's convenient functional layout components.

## How it works

Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.
It's built with
[flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes together.
