# Skeleton

> `<b-skeleton>` is a BootstrapVue custom component, that allows you to display a loading state for
> several component types while your data is being fetched or computed.

**Example: Basic usage**

<Canvas of={SkeletonStory.Skeleton} />

## Types

`<b-skeleton>` supports various basic types, to represent various components in your project.

<Canvas of={SkeletonStory.Types} />

## Skeleton animations

`<b-skeleton>` supports different animations. You can set them per component or change it globally
in the [settings](/docs/reference/settings).

<Canvas of={SkeletonStory.SkeletonAnimations} />

## Helper components

Utilize `<b-skeleton>` helper components to quickly scaffold existing components.

### Table

`<b-skeleton-table>` allows you to scaffold a basic table structure by utilizing the `rows` and
`columns` props to define the size of the table. You can pass props directly to the table via the
`table-props` property, which supports the same props as `<b-table-simple>`. Refer to the
`<b-table-simple>` [documentation](/docs/components/table#comp-ref-b-table-simple) for a complete
list.

<Canvas of={SkeletonStory.Table} />

### Image

Utilize `<b-skeleton-img>` to represent images. It utilizes a 16:9 aspect ratio by default, for a
responsive sizing. You can overwrite this by applying `no-aspect` and utilize the `height` and
`width` props to set your own sizing.

<Canvas of={SkeletonStory.Image} />

#### Card Image

Use `<b-skeleton-img>` to represent images in `<b-card>`. Remember to set the `card-img` prop to the
position of the image. This will apply the proper border-radius.

<Canvas of={SkeletonStory.CardImage} />

## Icons

`<b-skeleton-icon>` can also be used as placeholder for icons. If you need to use any icon props,
you can pass them via the `icon-props` property.

<Canvas of={SkeletonStory.Icons} />

**Note:** The `throb` animation does not work with `b-skeleton-icon`.

## Styling and customization

The `<b-skeleton>` component and helper components utilizes Bootstrap SCSS variables, as much as
possible to best match the styling and sizing of the native components. This means if you've
customized Bootstrap SCSS, the skeleton components should adapt to fit your custom theming.

We've also provided a few custom SCSS variables, that can be used to further customize the styling
of the various `<b-skeleton>` components. You can read more about how to change these variables in
the [theming section](/docs/reference/theming#bootstrapvue-sass-variables).
