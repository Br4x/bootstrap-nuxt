## Breadcrumb items

Items are rendered using `:items` prop. It can be an array of objects to provide link and active
state. Links can be `href`'s for anchor tags, or `to`'s for router-links. Breadcrumb works under the
assumption that there is one active link in every set of ordered breadcrumbs, so the active state of
the last element is automatically set to `false`.


```js
const items = [
  {
    text: 'Home',
    href: 'https://google.com'
  },
  {
    text: 'Posts',
    to: { name: 'home' }
  },
  {
    text: 'Another Story',
    active: true
  }
]
```

Refer to the [Router support](/docs/reference/router-links) reference page for router-link specific
props.

## Manually placed items

You may also manually place individual `<b-breadcrumb-item>` child components in the default slot of
the `<b-breadcrumb>` component, as an alternative to using the `items` prop, for greater control
over the content of each item:

<Canvas of={Breadcrumb.ManuallyPlaced} />

Remember to set the `active` prop on the last item.

`<b-breadcrumb-item>` also supports the various `<router-link>` props such as `to`, etc.
