# Alert

> Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and
> flexible alert messages.

## Overview

Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button (and optional
auto-dismissing).

<Canvas of={Alert.Overview} />

## Visible state

Use the `show` prop to control the visibility state of the alert. By default alerts are **not**
shown. Set the prop `show` to explicitly display them.

The `show` prop accepts boolean `true` or `false` to show and hide the alert respectively. It can
also be set to a positive integer (representing seconds) to create a self dismissing alert. See the
[Auto Dismissing Alerts](#auto-dismissing-alerts) section below for details.

### `v-model` support

You can use the `v-model` directive to create two-way data bindings on the `show` prop as in
`v-model="showDismissibleAlert"` above. Useful when you use dismissible because when user closes the
alert, your variable will be updated. Do not use the `show` prop when using `v-model`.

## Contextual variants

For proper styling of `<b-alert>`, use one of the four required contextual variants by setting the
`variant` prop to one of the following: `info`, `success`, `warning` or `danger`. The default is
`info`.

<Canvas of={Alert.ContextualVariants} />

### Conveying meaning to assistive technologies

Using color variants to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to
users of assistive technologies â€“ such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the
color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through
alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the `.sr-only` class.

## Additional content inside alerts

`<b-alerts>` can also contain additional HTML elements like headings and paragraphs, which will be
styled with the appropriate color matching the variant.

### Color of links within alerts

Use the `.alert-link` utility CSS class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert.
Use on `<a>` or `<b-link>`.

<Canvas of={Alert.AlertLinks} />

## Dismissible alerts

Using the `dismissible` prop it's possible to dismiss any `<b-alert>` inline. This will add a close
`X` button. Use the `dismiss-label` prop to change the hidden label text associated with the dismiss
button.

<Canvas of={Alert.AlertDismissible} />

### Auto dismissing alerts

To create a `<b-alert>` that dismisses automatically after a period of time, set the `show` prop (or
the `v-model`) to the number of seconds you would like the `<b-alert>` to remain visible for. Only
integer number of seconds are supported.

<Canvas of={Alert.AutoDismissible} />

## Fading alerts

Use the `fade` prop to enable animation. By default alerts are not animated.
