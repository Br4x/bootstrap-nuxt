# Media

> The media object helps build complex and repetitive components where some media is positioned
> alongside content that doesn't wrap around said media. Plus, it does this with only two required
> classes thanks to flexbox.

## Usage

<Canvas of={MediaStory.Usage} />

## No body (with sub-components)

<Canvas of={MediaStory.NoBodyWithSubComponents} />

## Order

Change the order of content in media objects by adding `right-align` property.

<Canvas of={MediaStory.Order} />

## Nesting

You can easily nest media objects by including another `<b-media>` inside parent's body.

## Vertical align

Aside can be vertically aligned using `vertical-align` prop, set to `top`, `center` or `end`. The
default alignment is `top`.

## Media list

Because the media object has few structural requirements, you can use this component as a list item
in HTML lists. On your `<ul>` or `<ol>`, add the class `list-unstyled` to remove any browser default
list styles, and then use the `<b-media>` component with `tag` prop set to `li`. As always, use
spacing utilities wherever needed to fine tune.
