# Aspect

> The `<b-aspect>` component can be used to maintain a minimum responsive aspect ratio for content.
> When the content is longer than the available height, then the component will expand vertically to
> fit all content. If the content is shorter than the computed aspect height, the component will
> ensure a minimum height is maintained.

## Overview

The default [aspect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)>) ratio is `1:1` (ratio of
`1`), which makes the height always be at least the same as the width. The `aspect` prop can be used
to specify an arbitrary aspect ratio (i.e. `1.5`) or a ratio as a string such as `'16:9'` or
`'4:3'`.

The width will always be 100% of the available width in the parent element/component.
