# Button Group

> Group a series of buttons together on a single line with `<b-button-group>`.

## Overview

Button Groups are an easy way to group a series of buttons together.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroup.Overview} />

## Sizing

Set the `size` prop to `lg` or `sm` to render larger or smaller, respectively, buttons. There is no
need to specify the size on the individual buttons.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroup.Sizing} />

## Vertical variation

Make a set of buttons appear vertically stacked rather than horizontally by setting the `vertical`
prop. Split button dropdowns are not supported here.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroup.VerticalVariation} />

## Dropdown menu support

Add [`<b-dropdown>`](/docs/components-dropdown--docs) menus directly inside your `<b-button-group>`. Note
that split dropdown menus are not supported when prop `vertical` is set.
