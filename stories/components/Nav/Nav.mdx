# Nav

> Navigation available in Bootstrap share general markup and styles, from the base `<b-nav>` class
> to the `active` and `disabled` states. Swap modifier props to switch between each style.

<Canvas of={Nav.Navigation} />

## Overview

The base `<b-nav>` component is built with flexbox and provides a strong foundation for building all
types of navigation components. It includes some style overrides (for working with lists), some link
padding for larger hit areas, and basic disabled styling. No active states are included in the base
nav.

`<b-nav>` supports the following child components:

- `<b-nav-item>` for actionable links (or router-links)
- `<b-nav-item-dropdown>` for dropdowns
- `<b-nav-text>` for plain text content
- `<b-nav-form>` for inline forms

## Link appearance

Two style variations are supported: `tabs` and `pills`, which support `active` state styling. These
variants are mutually exclusive - use only one style or the other.

### Tab style

Make the nav look like tabs by setting the `tabs` prop.

<Canvas of={Nav.TabStyle} />

### Pill style

Use the pill style by setting the `pills` prop.

<Canvas of={Nav.PillStyle} />

### Small

Make the nav smaller by setting the `small` prop.

<Canvas of={Nav.Small} />

## Fill and justify

Force your `<b-nav>` content to extend the full available width.

### Fill

To proportionately fill all available space with your `<b-nav-item>` components, set the `fill`
prop. Notice that all horizontal space is occupied, but not every nav item has the same width.

<Canvas of={Nav.Fill} />

### Justified

For equal-width elements, set the `justified` prop instead. All horizontal space will be occupied by
nav links, but unlike `fill` above, every `<b-nav-item>` will be the same width.

<Canvas of={Nav.Justified} />

## Alignment

To align your `<b-nav-item>` components, use the `align` prop. Available values are `left`, `center`
and `right`.

<Canvas of={Nav.Alignment} />

## Vertical variation

By default `<b-nav>` appear on a horizontal line. Stack your navigation by setting the `vertical`
prop.

<Canvas of={Nav.VerticalVariation} />

## Dropdown support

Use `<b-nav-item-dropdown>` to place dropdown items within your nav.

<Canvas of={Nav.DropdownSupport} />

Sometimes you want to add your own class names to the generated dropdown toggle button, that by
default have the classes `nav-link` and `dropdown-toggle`. Use the `toggle-class` prop to add them
(like above) which will render HTML similar to:

<Canvas of={Nav.DropdownSupportWithToogleClass} />

Refer to [`<b-dropdown>`](/docs/components/dropdown) for a list of supported sub-components.

### Optionally scoped default slot

The dropdown default slot is optionally scoped with the following scope available:

| Property or Method | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hide()`           | Can be used to close the dropdown menu. Accepts an optional boolean argument, which if `true` returns focus to the toggle button |

### Lazy dropdown

By default, `<b-nav-item-dropdown>` renders the menu contents in the DOM even when the menu is not
shown. When there are a large number of dropdowns rendered on the same page, performance could be
impacted due to larger overall memory utilization. You can instruct `<b-nav-item-dropdown>` to
render the menu contents only when it is shown by setting the `lazy` prop to true.

### Dropdown placement

Use the dropdown props `right`, `dropup`, `dropright`, `dropleft`, `no-flip`, and `offset` to
control the positioning of `<b-nav-item-dropdown>`.

Refer to the [`<b-dropdown>` positioning section](/docs/components/dropdown#positioning) for details
on the effects and usage of these props.

### Dropdown implementation note

Note that the toggle button is actually rendered as a link `<a>` tag with `role="button"` for
styling purposes, and typically has the `href` set to `#` unless an ID is provided via the `id`
prop.

The toggle will prevent scroll-top-top behaviour (via JavaScript) when clicking the toggle link. In
some cases when using SSR, and the user clicks the toggle button _before_ Vue has had a chance to
hydrate the component, the page will scroll to top. In these cases, simply providing a unique ID via
the `id` prop will prevent the unwanted scroll-to-top behaviour.

## Nav text content

Use the `<b-nav-text>` child component to place plain text content into the nav:

<Canvas of={Nav.NavTextContent} />

## Nav inline forms

Use the `<b-nav-form>` child component to place an _inline_ form into the nav:

<Canvas of={Nav.NavInlineForms} />

Refer to the [`<b-form>` inline](/docs/components/form#inline-form) documentation for additional
details on placing form controls.

## Tabbed local content support

See the [`<b-tabs>`](/docs/components/tabs) component for creating tabbable panes of local content
(not suited for navigation).

## Card integration

Use a `<b-nav>` in a [`<b-card>`](/docs/components/card) header, by enabling the `card-header` prop
on `<b-nav>` and setting either the `pills` or `tabs` props:

**Tabs style:**

<Canvas of={Nav.CardIntegration} />

**Pill style:**

```html
<div>
  <b-card title="Card Title" no-body>
    <b-card-header header-tag="nav">
      <b-nav card-header pills>
        <b-nav-item active>Active</b-nav-item>
        <b-nav-item>Inactive</b-nav-item>
        <b-nav-item disabled>Disabled</b-nav-item>
      </b-nav>
    </b-card-header>

    <b-card-body class="text-center">
      <b-card-text>
        With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.
      </b-card-text>

      <b-button variant="primary">Go somewhere</b-button>
    </b-card-body>
  </b-card>
</div>


```

**Plain style:**

The `card-header` prop is only needed when you are applying `tabs` or `pills` style. Note that
Bootstrap v4 SCSS does not have special styling for `active` state plain style nav items.

```html
<div>
  <b-card title="Card Title" no-body>
    <b-card-header header-tag="nav">
      <b-nav>
        <b-nav-item active>Active</b-nav-item>
        <b-nav-item>Inactive</b-nav-item>
        <b-nav-item disabled>Disabled</b-nav-item>
      </b-nav>
    </b-card-header>

    <b-card-body class="text-center">
      <b-card-text>
        With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.
      </b-card-text>

      <b-button variant="primary">Go somewhere</b-button>
    </b-card-body>
  </b-card>
</div>


```

The `card-header` prop has no styling effect if the `<b-nav>` is in `vertical` mode.

### Using with Vue Router

Have your card `<b-nav>` control vue router nested routes via `<router-view>` or `<nuxt-child>`
components, to created tabbed content that changes with route URL:

```html
// On page with route `/some/route`
<div>
  <b-card title="Card Title" no-body>
    <b-card-header header-tag="nav">
      <b-nav card-header tabs>
        <!-- <b-nav-item>'s with child routes. Note the trailing slash on the first <b-nav-item> -->
        <b-nav-item to="/some/route/" exact exact-active-class="active">Active</b-nav-item>
        <b-nav-item to="/some/route/foo" exact exact-active-class="active">Foo</b-nav-item>
        <b-nav-item to="/some/route/bar" exact exact-active-class="active">Bar</b-nav-item>
      </b-nav>
    </b-card-header>

    <b-card-body>
      <!-- Child route gets rendered in <router-view> or <nuxt-child> -->
      <router-view></router-view>
      <!-- Or if using Nuxt.js
      <nuxt-child></nuxt-child>
      -->
    </b-card-body>
  </b-card>
</div>
```

## Accessibility

If you're using `<b-nav>` to provide a navigation bar, be sure to add a `role="navigation"` to the
most logical parent container of `<b-nav>`, or wrap a `<nav>` element around `<b-nav>`. Do **not**
add the role to the `<b-nav>` itself, as this would prevent it from being announced as an actual
list by assistive technologies.

When using a `<b-nav-item-dropdown>` in your `<b-nav>`, be sure to assign a unique `id` prop value
to the `<b-nav-item-dropdown>` so that the appropriate `aria-*` attributes can be automatically
generated.

### Tabbed interface accessibility

Note that navigation bars, even if visually styled as tabs, should **not** be given
`role="tablist"`, `role="tab"` or `role="tabpanel"` attributes. These are only appropriate for
[tabbed interfaces](/docs/components/tabs) that do not change the URL or `$route`, as described in
the [WAI ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel). See
[`<b-tabs>`](/docs/components/tabs) for dynamic tabbed interfaces that are compliant with WAI ARIA.

Tabbed interfaces should avoid using dropdown menus, as this causes both usability and accessibility
issues:

- From a usability perspective, the fact that the currently displayed tab’s trigger element is not
  immediately visible (as it’s inside the closed dropdown menu) can cause confusion.
- From an accessibility point of view, there is currently no sensible way to map this sort of
  construct to a standard WAI ARIA pattern, meaning that it cannot be easily made understandable to
  users of assistive technologies.
